# example

This is a contrived spring boot application. 

The application collects user data and stores in h2 in-memory database. 

There are 2 REST endpoints 

1. POST /users : To create user 
2. GET /users: To list all the users

## Requirement

1. Tested with Java8 and Maven 3
2. GitHub account. 


## Goal

1. Implement the saveUser method in UserService to make the POST endpoint work. 
2. Implement the allUsers method in UserService to make the GET endpoint work. 
3. Note that the response structure requires calculation of age and bmi (body mass index) of the user.

 bmi = (weight-in-kg) / (height-in-meters) * (height-in-meters)

4. Create packages and extra classes as needed. 

[optional]
5. Add proper validations.
6. Write unit tests as required for service methods.
7. Create a working update endpoint. 
[optional]

8. When you are done, please create a pull request in github for review and assessment.
